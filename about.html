<p>Biography: My name is Brandon Arroyave, I was born in Miami, Florida. I'm very passionate about design and arts, last year,
I completed a course on interior decoration and have played the piano & guitar since a very young age, surprisingly enough,
my major is neither interior design or audio production, but Graphic Design. I consider myself very passionate about art,
I love to draw, paint and mix different medias for my artworks. Consider this a formal invitation to check out my work on the
rest of the tabs.

<h1>- Welcome to DonnArrt.com. -</h1>
<h2> Graphic design student, writer & blogger.</h2>
<p>Welcome, my name is Brandon. I'm a 19-year-old student from Miami, Florida who speaks english, spanish and some french. I'm very passionate about design and arts, last year, besides my college studies I am also an interior decorator and have played the piano & guitar since a very young age, surprisingly enough, my major is neither interior design or audio production, but Graphic Design. I'm very passionate about art, drawing, painting and even writting. Consider this a formal invitation to check out my work on the rest of the tabs.
